# About Interna
Interna is basicly bigger project which is meant to be bigger software for club management.
Core is one part of this. Core can be used and should be treated as framework of it's own.
Core provides advanced functionality to develop applications with CQRS architecture.
Core provides such functionalities as:
*  CommandBus
*  EventBus
*  .volt powered views
*  Full Phalcon functionality

To use this as "framework" you should be familiar with Phalcon itself.
What isn't in the docs is probably found from Phalcon's documentation.
